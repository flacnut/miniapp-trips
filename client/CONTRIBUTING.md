# Reporting problems and getting help
We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/facebookexternal/fb_applets/issues) as a public forum for bugs and general questions about Mini Apps development. Try searching in the closed issues first before creating a new issue to see if your question has already been answered.

If you don’t want to share the details of your issue publicly, get help by [contacting us directly](https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/1258886824559730).

## Opening a new public issue

When you open a new issue, include as much information as you can about your situation.

Try to include these in your issue:
 * Exact steps for reproducing the problem (if applicable)
 * Step-by-step description of what the expected behavior should be
 * Screenshots or video of the problem (if applicable)
 * Log output or stacktrace (if applicable)
 * Labels for triaging and filtering purposes, for example: documentation, dev portal
 * .zip file in question (if applicable)

## Feature requests
If you have suggestions for new features, or changes to existing ones, we'd love to hear them! Please submit each suggestion as a separate new issue and be sure to include the enhancement label.

## Pull Requests
At this point, we don’t take any external pull request. We will update here once we actively welcome your pull requests.

## Bug bounty program
Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
